# The Dimensionality Gap: DNNs vs Visual Cortex

Hey!

If you're here, you probably scanned the QR code on my poster at CCN (Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience) 2022. This repository contains my poster (linked below) if you want to take a closer look at it. If you have any comments, suggestions, questions or general feedback, please contact me (Raj) at rgautha1@jh.edu!

Thanks for your interest! :D
